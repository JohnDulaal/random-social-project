                The Structure of the Legislature in Nepal:
            </h2>

           <p>
            Nepal operates under a federal system of government with a bicameral legislature. The legislature is divided into two houses: the House of Representatives (Pratinidhi Sabha) and the National Assembly (Rashtriya Sabha). The House of Representatives is the lower house, while the National Assembly is the upper house. Together, they make up the federal parliament, which has the power to enact, amend, and repeal laws, as well as scrutinize the executive branch.
