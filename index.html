                The judiciary in Nepal serves as the cornerstone of justice and the rule of law in the country. Headed by the Supreme Court, it interprets the constitution, resolves legal disputes, and safeguards citizens' rights. Nepal's judiciary is crucial in upholding the principles of justice and fairness while ensuring that laws passed by the legislature comply with the constitution. The legal system in Nepal combines civil and customary law, reflecting its rich cultural and legal heritage. Despite facing challenges like case backlogs and the need for legal reforms, the judiciary remains a vital institution in Nepal, dedicated to preserving the rule of law and protecting the rights of its diverse population.

            The executive branch of Nepal is a key component of the country's governance structure. In this federal democratic republic, the executive is headed by the President, who serves as the ceremonial head of state. The President's roles include appointing the Prime Minister and other high-ranking officials, representing the nation, and performing various constitutional duties. However, the real power and governance responsibilities rest with the Prime Minister, who is the head of government. The Prime Minister, appointed by the President, leads the day-to-day administration of the country, formulates and implements policies, and oversees government ministries and agencies. The executive branch plays a pivotal role in shaping Nepal's political landscape, ensuring effective governance, and addressing the nation's evolving challenges. <span class="hig">The current Prime Minsiter(Head of Executive) of Nepal is Pushpa Kamal Dahal.</span></p>
